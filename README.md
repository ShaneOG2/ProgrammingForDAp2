# Programming for Data Analysis - Project 2 #

## Overview ##
This repository contains my work for Project 2 of the the Programming for Data Analysis Module at ATU as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analytics). This repository contains: 

- The Jupyter notebook `Analysis.ipynb` which contains the main body of work. 
- A folder named `content` which contains images used in `Analysis.ipynb`. 
- A csv `data.csv` which contains the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29" target="_blank">Wisconsin-Breast Cancer (Diagnostics) dataset</a> which we will use in `Analysis.ipynb`. 
- This README file which contains the project statement and how to get `Analysis.ipynb` running.

## Project Statement ##  

- Undertake an analysis/review of the dataset and present an overview and background. 
- Provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset and compare their performance.
- Present a statistical analysis of the dataset. 
- Using a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset (using SKLearn etc.) and present.classification performance results. Detail your rationale for the parameter selections you made while training the classifiers.
- Compare, contrast and critique your results with reference to the literature. 
- Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended â€“ using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints. 
- Document your work in a Jupyter notebook.

## Intructions to Reader ## 

Download and run `Analysis.ipynb` on your local machine. 

To do:
1. Go to my repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/ShaneOG2/ProgrammingForDAp2).
2. Click on the green `<> Code` button and `Download Zip`.
3. Save folder to your local machine. 
4. Navigate to where you saved this folder using your command line. 
5. Type `jupyter notebook` - this will open and run `Analysis.ipynb` in your browser.
